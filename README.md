# Memory Kards

## Flashcards App created for CS50x Final Project.

This is Memory Kards, a flashcards application in which the user can create cards to help them memorize concepts of any theme
possible. The main motivation for this project is my need to study for a public exam that's gonna happen in the end of July,
so I created this to assist my studies.

## Functionalities

The main feature is the card creation, in which one can create a card with a specific question and an specific answer, additionally
the user can also name a Tag for each card, for filter purposes.

The user is also able to edit and delete existant cards. All cards must have an unique question, and are required to have the question
and the answer fields not null.

In the train section, the user can filter the cards by tag, or access all cards if no tag is chosen, all cards with no tag name provided will
be tagged as 'untagged'.
